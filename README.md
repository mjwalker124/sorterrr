### Description
This is a group auto allocation management system in ruby on rails 


### Warning
This is not all my work, I am aiming to update with the original git information to be able to properly acredit people's work.

This was done as part of a team of four.

My focus was on the interaction with the manual group management, while David was focused on automating it.
